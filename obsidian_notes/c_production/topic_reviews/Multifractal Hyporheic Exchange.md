### The Potential Fractal and Multifractal Behavior of Hyporheic Exchange and Residence Times in River Networks: The Role of Climate and Geology

Hyporheic exchange, the mixing of surface water and groundwater in the hyporheic zone, plays a crucial role in the biogeochemical processes of river systems. Understanding the behavior of hyporheic exchange and residence times is essential for predicting nutrient cycling, contaminant transport, and overall ecosystem health. Recent studies have explored the potential fractal and multifractal properties of hyporheic exchange and residence times, suggesting that these processes may exhibit complex scaling behaviors influenced by riverbed topography, climate, and geology.

#### Fractal and Multifractal Properties

Fractals are structures that exhibit self-similarity across scales, meaning that their patterns repeat at different levels of magnification. Multifractals, on the other hand, involve a spectrum of fractal dimensions, reflecting a more complex and heterogeneous scaling behavior. In the context of hyporheic exchange, fractal properties have been observed in the topography of riverbeds, which can influence the flow patterns and residence times of water in the hyporheic zone.

Lee et al. (2020) demonstrated that riverbeds exhibit fractal patterns across various scales, from individual grains to larger bedforms and bars. Their study highlighted that hyporheic exchange is more sensitive to the fractal dimension of riverbed topography than to the size of bedforms, suggesting that the complexity of the riverbed surface plays a crucial role in driving hyporheic flows (Lee et al., 2020). This implies that hyporheic exchange may indeed exhibit multifractal properties, as the riverbed topography can vary significantly across different sections of a river, leading to variations in hyporheic exchange rates and residence times.

Sawyer and Cardenas (2009) further supported this notion by showing that the residence time distributions (RTDs) in hyporheic zones can follow power-law behaviors, indicative of fractal scaling. Their experiments revealed that both heterogeneous and homogeneous sediments exhibit power-law tails in their RTDs, with the exponent reflecting the underlying fractal properties of the flow paths (Sawyer & Cardenas, 2009).

#### Influence of Climate and Geology

Maxwell et al. (2016) expanded the understanding of hyporheic exchange and residence times by incorporating the role of climate and geology. Their study modeled groundwater residence times at a continental scale, revealing that peak residence times are controlled by the mean hydraulic conductivity, a function of the prevailing geology. Additionally, the shape of the residence time distribution is influenced by aridity, which determines the water table depth and the frequency of shorter flow paths (Maxwell et al., 2016).

In more humid basins with greater precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P-ET), the water table tends to follow the fractal topography more closely, leading to a greater prevalence of local flow paths and stagnation points. This results in a wider range of residence times and larger semivariances. In contrast, arid basins with lower P-ET have deeper, flatter water tables, leading to fewer local flow paths and smaller semivariances (Maxwell et al., 2016). This relationship between aridity and residence time distribution suggests that climate plays a significant role in modulating the fractal or multifractal behavior of hyporheic exchange.

Geology also exerts a strong influence on the fractal properties of hyporheic exchange. Fractal residence time distributions have been attributed to fractal topography rather than subsurface heterogeneity alone. Simple water-table geometries in homogeneous materials can exhibit fractal behaviors, and heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity can amplify these fractal signals (Maxwell et al., 2016). This underscores the importance of considering both surface and subsurface geological features when evaluating the scaling properties of hyporheic exchange and residence times.

#### Power-law Distributions in Residence Times

The distribution of residence times in the hyporheic zone provides further insight into the behavior of hyporheic exchange. Haggerty et al. (2002) found that the residence time distribution in a 2nd-order mountain stream follows a power-law, with a long tail scaling as t−1.28t^{-1.28}t−1.28. This power-law distribution implies a wide range of exchange timescales, from short to very long durations (Haggerty et al., 2002). Similarly, Sawyer and Cardenas (2009) observed that permeability heterogeneity in cross-bedded sediment creates long hyporheic exchange paths, resulting in residence time distributions with long tails that conform to a power-law (Sawyer & Cardenas, 2009).

Bayani Cardenas et al. (2008) investigated the effects of bedform geometry on hyporheic exchange using numerical simulations, demonstrating that different bedform shapes significantly influence residence times. The study found that residence time distributions in bedform-driven hyporheic exchange exhibit power-law behaviors, further supporting the notion that these processes are governed by fractal or multifractal dynamics (Bayani Cardenas et al., 2008).

#### Conclusion

The evidence from recent studies indicates that hyporheic exchange and residence times in river networks are likely to exhibit multifractal properties. The fractal topography of riverbeds, combined with the influence of climate and geology, creates a complex and heterogeneous environment that drives variable hyporheic flows and residence times. While fractal scaling is a significant component, the multifractal nature of these processes reflects the diverse and interconnected factors at play.

Future research should focus on further quantifying the multifractal properties of hyporheic exchange and residence times across different climatic and geological settings. By integrating advanced modeling techniques and field observations, a more comprehensive understanding of these complex behaviors can be achieved, enhancing our ability to predict and manage the ecological functions of river systems.
