### Analysis and Terminology in Biogeochemical Function Focused on the Hyporheic Zone

#### 1. Introduction to Terminology and Analytical Approaches

In the study of biogeochemical functions within the hyporheic zone, selecting appropriate terminology is crucial to accurately reflect the complexity and variability of these processes across different scales. Various terms have been proposed to describe these functions, each with distinct advantages and limitations. For example, "Hyporheic Biogeochemical Function" specifically identifies the location of biogeochemical processes but may be perceived as neglecting interactions with broader riverine and groundwater systems. "Integrated Hyporheic Function" underscores the integration of biogeochemical functions within the hyporheic zone while acknowledging interactions with other systems; however, it may not fully encapsulate the scale-dependent nature of these processes. The term "Scale-Dependent Hyporheic Function" directly addresses the variability of hyporheic processes with scale, though it might be considered cumbersome. "Hyporheic Biogeochemical Processes" focuses on specific processes within the hyporheic zone but does not inherently emphasize their cumulative impact. Finally, "Cumulative Hyporheic Function" highlights the cumulative nature of hyporheic processes, integrating the effects across multiple scales, though this term requires clear definition to ensure comprehensive understanding.

A recommended approach combines these terminologies to more effectively communicate the scale-dependent nature of hyporheic processes. Specifically, "Localized Hyporheic Processes" can be used to refer to small-scale biogeochemical activities within specific reaches of the hyporheic zone, while "Cumulative Hyporheic Function" can describe the integrated biogeochemical functions over larger spatial scales, such as entire river networks.

#### 2. Analysis of Key Variables in Hyporheic Exchange Modeling

The study by Gomez and Harvey (2014) introduces the NEXSS (Networks with EXchange and Subsurface Storage) model, which estimates hyporheic exchange in river networks using several key variables. These include bankfull channel width (wbfw_{bf}wbf​), discharge (QbfQ_{bf}Qbf​), median grain size (D50D_{50}D50​), channel slope (SSS), sinuosity (sns_nsn​), and regional hydraulic head gradient (JxJ_xJx​ and JyJ_yJy​). These variables are technically defined and also explained in simpler terms for broader accessibility.

Bankfull channel width (wbfw_{bf}wbf​) and discharge (QbfQ_{bf}Qbf​) are geomorphic variables representing the width and flow of the river when it is full to the top of its banks. These are estimated using empirical downstream hydraulic geometry relations. Median grain size (D50D_{50}D50​) refers to the median size of sediment particles in the riverbed, which affects permeability and, consequently, hyporheic exchange. Channel slope (SSS) measures the gradient or steepness of the river channel, influencing the velocity of flow and the energy available for hyporheic exchange. Sinuosity (sns_nsn​) quantifies the meandering nature of the river, affecting the length of the flow path and the extent of lateral hyporheic exchange. The regional hydraulic head gradient (JxJ_xJx​ and JyJ_yJy​) represents the regional pressure differences driving groundwater flow, which in turn influences the exchange between surface water and groundwater. Finally, hyporheic exchange flux (qhzq_{hz}qhz​) and residence time (τ50\tau_{50}τ50​) quantify the volume of water exchanged between the river and its sediments and the time water spends in the hyporheic zone, respectively.

#### 3. Total Volumetric Amount of Exchange

The "total volumetric amount of exchange" (Qhz,ωQ_{hz,\omega}Qhz,ω​) in the context of Gomez and Harvey's study is defined as the product of the hyporheic exchange flux per unit area (qhzq_{hz}qhz​) and the total stream surface area for each stream order (AωA_{\omega}Aω​):

Qhz,ω=Aω⋅qhzQ_{hz,\omega} = A_{\omega} \cdot q_{hz}Qhz,ω​=Aω​⋅qhz​

Where:

Aω=nω⋅Lω⋅wωA_{\omega} = n_{\omega} \cdot L_{\omega} \cdot w_{\omega}Aω​=nω​⋅Lω​⋅wω​

Here, nωn_{\omega}nω​ represents the number of reaches, LωL_{\omega}Lω​ is the length of each reach, and wωw_{\omega}wω​ is the width of each reach. This equation provides the total volume of water exchanged between the river and its sediments for a specific stream order. This is distinct from "cumulative hyporheic exchange," which integrates the hyporheic processes across all stream orders, providing a holistic view of the river network's impact on biogeochemical processes.

#### 4. Benefits of the NEXSS Model and Comparison to Cumulative Hyporheic Function

The NEXSS model offers several significant advantages for understanding hyporheic exchange across river networks. It is a physically-based model, meaning it relies on empirical relationships and measurable parameters, which provides more accurate and realistic predictions. The model incorporates multiple scales, capturing the complexity and variability of hyporheic exchange processes. This multi-scale consideration is essential for understanding cumulative hyporheic function, as it integrates exchange processes across different scales. NEXSS also has strong predictive capabilities, allowing for forecasts of how changes in geomorphic features, land use, or climate might impact hyporheic exchange.

Additionally, NEXSS emphasizes the biogeochemical potential of hyporheic zones, showing how hyporheic exchange influences nutrient cycling and water quality. The model's ability to distinguish between vertical and lateral exchanges further enhances its utility, providing a more nuanced understanding of how different types of exchange contribute to cumulative hyporheic function. Moreover, the flexibility of applying NEXSS to both synthetic and real river networks makes it a valuable tool for diverse applications.

When comparing NEXSS to studies of cumulative hyporheic function, it becomes clear that both approaches recognize the importance of integrating processes across scales. NEXSS’s detailed, multi-scale data directly supports cumulative studies, offering comprehensive insights into biogeochemical impacts and enhancing predictive utility.

#### 5. Integrating NEXSS Data into Cumulative Hyporheic Function Analysis

Integrating reach-scale predictions from NEXSS into the analysis of cumulative hyporheic function can provide a more comprehensive understanding of these processes across entire river networks. The approach involves using NEXSS to predict hyporheic exchange flux (qhzq_{hz}qhz​), residence time (τ50\tau_{50}τ50​), and biogeochemical potential at the reach scale. This data is then aggregated across the network to calculate cumulative metrics such as total volumetric exchange (Qhz,cumulativeQ_{hz,\text{cumulative}}Qhz,cumulative​) and overall biogeochemical transformation potential.

The cumulative volumetric exchange is calculated by summing the contributions from each stream order:

Qhz,cumulative=∑ω∑i(Aω,i⋅qhz,ω,i)Q_{hz,\text{cumulative}} = \sum_{\omega} \sum_{i} \left( A_{\omega,i} \cdot q_{hz,\omega,i} \right)Qhz,cumulative​=ω∑​i∑​(Aω,i​⋅qhz,ω,i​)

Where Aω,iA_{\omega,i}Aω,i​ and qhz,ω,iq_{hz,\omega,i}qhz,ω,i​ are the surface area and hyporheic exchange flux for reach iii in stream order ω\omegaω. This integrative approach allows for a holistic view of hyporheic function, enhancing the accuracy of predictions and supporting informed management strategies.

#### 6. Conclusion

Incorporating NEXSS modeled data at the reach scale into cumulative hyporheic function analysis provides a detailed, scalable, and predictive framework for understanding and managing hyporheic processes across river networks. By integrating detailed geomorphic and hydraulic data with biogeochemical potential, this approach offers comprehensive insights into how hyporheic zones influence riverine ecosystem health and water quality, aligning with the goals of cumulative hyporheic function studies.
