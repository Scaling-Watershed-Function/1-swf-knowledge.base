#### 1. **Introduction**

Cumulative hyporheic exchange refers to the total amount of water and solutes that are exchanged between the surface water and the hyporheic zone over a defined spatial extent, such as a river reach, stream segment, or entire watershed. This concept is critical for understanding how localized hyporheic processes, which occur at the scale of individual bedforms or sediment structures, scale up to influence biogeochemical functions across larger spatial extents, including entire river networks.

The interpretation of cumulative hyporheic exchange is complex and scale-dependent. At smaller scales, cumulative hyporheic exchange captures the sum of water moving across multiple flow paths influenced by bedform geometry and sediment heterogeneity. As the scale increases to stream segments and entire watersheds, cumulative hyporheic exchange integrates the effects of larger geomorphological features and hydrological connectivity, potentially transitioning towards broader groundwater-surface water interactions.

In this report, we synthesize insights from several key studies to provide a comprehensive interpretation of cumulative hyporheic exchange, focusing on its scaling behavior, potential fractal or multifractal properties, and implications for riverine biogeochemical functions.

#### 2. **Interpretation of Cumulative Hyporheic Exchange Across Scales**

##### **Reach Scale**

- **Physical Interpretation:** At the reach scale, cumulative hyporheic exchange captures the total amount of water moving across multiple flow paths within a localized area. These flow paths are influenced by small-scale bedform features such as ripples and dunes, as well as the heterogeneity of the sediment. The cumulative effect at this scale primarily reflects the localized processes of infiltration and exfiltration driven by the immediate geomorphological and hydraulic conditions.
- **Processes Involved:** Localized infiltration and exfiltration due to small-scale bedforms; short-term storage and release of water within the hyporheic zone; high-frequency exchange driven by local hydraulic gradients.

##### **Stream Level**

- **Physical Interpretation:** At the stream level, cumulative hyporheic exchange accounts for the integrated effects of sequences of hydraulic features such as pools, riffles, and channel bends. The cumulative effect at this scale reflects more complex interactions between localized flow paths and broader hydrological processes. This level of cumulative exchange begins to integrate the influence of larger geomorphological features and may show signs of scaling behavior.
- **Processes Involved:** Enhanced mixing and exchange due to the interaction of upwelling and downwelling zones; influence of stream morphology on hyporheic flow patterns; intermediate-term storage and release of water as it moves through sequences of geomorphological features.

##### **Sub-Basin and Basin Scales**

- **Physical Interpretation:** At the sub-basin and basin scales, cumulative hyporheic exchange encompasses larger geomorphological features such as river bars, islands, and alluvial fans. The integrated cumulative exchange at these scales reflects the broader hydrological connectivity and interactions between surface water and groundwater systems. As the scale increases, the cumulative hyporheic exchange begins to resemble groundwater-surface water exchange more closely, representing the integrated effect of multiple localized exchanges across larger spatial extents.
- **Processes Involved:** Long-term storage and release of water due to larger-scale hydrological processes; influence of large-scale geomorphological structures on hyporheic flow dynamics; integration of multiple stream and reach scale processes.

This table synthesizes key insights from the attached papers, linking processes and variables across different scales to the interpretation of cumulative hyporheic exchange and residence times. It highlights how each study contributes to our understanding of these cumulative variables in river networks.

### Explanation of the Table

1. **Continental Scale:**
    
    - At the continental scale, cumulative hyporheic exchange and residence times are influenced by broad-scale geological and climatic factors. These factors include hydraulic conductivity, precipitation, and water table depth, which collectively impact the overall exchange rates and retention times across multiple basins and regions. Maxwell et al. (2016) provide a foundation for understanding these large-scale controls, showing how geology and climate govern groundwater residence times.
2. **Regional Scale:**
    
    - At the regional scale, cumulative hyporheic exchange and residence times integrate contributions from various basins within a region. Topographic slope, hydrological gradients, and streamflow regimes play crucial roles in shaping these cumulative variables. Maxwell et al. (2016) also address this scale, highlighting how regional terrain and hydrology influence groundwater dynamics, which can be extrapolated to understand hyporheic processes.
3. **Basin Scale:**
    
    - Moving to the basin scale, cumulative hyporheic exchange aggregates data from sub-basins, reflecting the influence of soil moisture content, vegetation cover, and infiltration rates. Wollheim et al. (2022) discuss the scaling of biogeochemical function with watershed size, which can be analogously applied to understanding how cumulative hyporheic exchange scales at this level.
4. **Sub-basin Scale:**
    
    - At the sub-basin scale, cumulative hyporheic exchange and residence times are shaped by riparian vegetation density, soil porosity, and stream order. These variables determine how local variations within a sub-basin impact the overall exchange and retention of water. More specific studies are needed to address this scale directly.
5. **Reach Scale:**
    
    - At the reach scale, detailed measurements of local exchange rates and residence times are essential for understanding how these variables contribute to broader patterns at higher scales. Bedform geometry, channel roughness, and local hydraulic gradients are key variables. Studies like Lee et al. (2020), Bayani Cardenas et al. (2008), Haggerty et al. (2002), and Sawyer and Cardenas (2009) provide insights into how these factors influence hyporheic exchange and residence times.

### 3. **Potential for Fractal and Multifractal Behavior**

The scaling behavior of cumulative hyporheic exchange across different spatial extents suggests the potential for fractal or multifractal properties. Several key studies have provided insights into this possibility:

- [[lee_etal_20_sensitivity_hyporheic_exchange_fractal_riverbeds]]: The study on the fractal properties of riverbeds demonstrates that the complexity of bedform structures influences hyporheic exchange. This suggests that the self-similar nature of these structures could lead to fractal scaling of hyporheic processes across different scales.
- [[sawyer_et_cardenas_09_residence_time_distribution]]: Their work on sediment heterogeneity highlights how variations in sediment properties create complex flow paths and residence times, potentially leading to multifractal behavior in cumulative hyporheic exchange as these processes scale up.
- [[haggerty_etal_02_power_law_residence_time]]: The introduction of power-law residence time distributions (RTDs) in the hyporheic zone provides evidence that hyporheic exchange processes may exhibit non-linear scaling behaviors, indicative of fractal or multifractal properties.

### 4. **Implications for Riverine Biogeochemical Functions**

The interpretation of cumulative hyporheic exchange has significant implications for understanding riverine biogeochemical functions:

- **Localized Hyporheic Processes:** At smaller scales, the cumulative hyporheic exchange is dominated by localized processes that directly influence nutrient cycling, pollutant attenuation, and organic matter transformation. These processes are critical for maintaining ecological health within specific reaches of the river.
- **Cumulative Hyporheic Function:** As the scale increases, the cumulative hyporheic exchange integrates the effects of these localized processes, potentially leading to emergent properties that influence broader biogeochemical functions at the scale of entire river networks. The scaling behavior of cumulative hyporheic exchange, whether linear, superlinear, or fractal, can significantly affect the efficiency and magnitude of these functions.
