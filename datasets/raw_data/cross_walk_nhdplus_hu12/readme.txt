This dataset was clipped from the CONUS dataset to obtain values corresponding to 
the Yakima and Willamette River Watershed only. To clip these data, we used a 
reference list of "comid's" after subsetting the the enhanced NHDPlus V.2.1 as the 
reference dataset for COMIDs (Blodgett_23_Network_Attributes). We subsetted the 
enhanced NHDPlus V.2. using the huc_4, which we derived as the first four digits
of the "reachcode" variable. Thus, most our datasets, unless indicated otherwise
correspond the the huc_4 1703 and 1709 for the Yakima and Willamette River Basins
respectively.
