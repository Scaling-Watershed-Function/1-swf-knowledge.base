## Checking in
- Some comments on project management, note taking, and obsidian
## On the Fly Agenda
- How are we going to do this work (temporal allocation)
- Accountability and authorship
- Reviewing data from [[Kyongho Son]]
## Notes
- [[Zhangshuan Hou]] has some ideas about how to connect not only averages but also variability in the estimates. 
- [[Zhangshuan Hou]] mentions that his time is covered by the MM campaign and have support from data science. He considers that this is a relevant project for ESS-DIVE in order to provide metadata preparation, compilation, and sharing. 
- [[Xinming Lin]] is supported by RC2
- [[Francisco J. Guerrero]] mentions that the expectation is that we all will be contributing co-authors to the manuscript generated. 
- How to create a master file/ dataset:
	- Hydrological database 
	- Model inputs and outputs (gaps from the NEXSS in predictors, HRZ, RT)
	- Landuse database (Start with the entire suite of land uses)
- [[Xinming Lin]] is currently working on data preparation for an LDRD project including wildfires that has some overlap with the watershed scaling function. Some of that effort plus the data provided by [[Kyongho Son]] could be leveraged to create the master data file.
- [[Francisco J. Guerrero]] will set up a [[Hackathon]] meeting [[Kyongho Son]], [[Francisco J. Guerrero]], [[Zhangshuan Hou]] and perhaps [[Micah Taylor]], [[James Stegen]].
- Needed by: End of February. 
- Needed:
	- A few slides by [[Kyongho Son]] summarizing the data available as of now. 
- Data could be stored on a shared drive. 
- There is a server with storage already in use, but we will explore this option on Tuesday.
