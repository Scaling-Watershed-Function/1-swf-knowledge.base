1. Download the web catalog app and install it in your system
2. Launch the app, look for Research Rabbit and click on Install
3. Once installed, open the app. 
4. Sign up to have a user account. I recommend using the same email address you have for Zotero and GitHub.
5. You can import zotero collections directly into research rabbit, but we are going to start a new collection for this quick tutorial. 
6. Name the new collection (be as specific as you can, so you can quickly recognize it on a quick search). Hit enter and you can start adding papers to it. 
7. You can add papers directly from the web by using "All Subject Areas"
8. Start building your collection and select papers based on earlier/later work. For builiding an initial background, I suggest to use earlier work. 
9. Once you build your collection, select all papers, and export the file as a BibTeX or CSV
