#### Note
[[Kyongho Son]] has provided different versions of the raw dataset for scaling analysis. In terms of the [[data_prep_scaling]] [[Scripts]], we now have to merge the data with land use (including entropy analysis), biogrochemical data, updated on 2023-01-16. 

The raw data that will go into the analysis include the following files:

230117_yrb_cmid_land_2011.csv
230117_yrb_respt_vars.csv
230118_yrb_hbgc_vars.csv

The QA/QC should start with a summary of each of the datasets, adjusting variable names (including header explanations), and creating pair plots.
