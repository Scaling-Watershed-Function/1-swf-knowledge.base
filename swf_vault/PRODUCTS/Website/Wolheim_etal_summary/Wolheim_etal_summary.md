#### TL;DR?
Here is the plain language summary:

Rivers connect multiple components of the earth system: land, oceans, and atmosphere. Through these connections, rivers regulate the metabolism of nutrients like carbon (i.e., biogeochemical function). Currently, researchers can estimate the metabolic rate of a stream reach or even a catchment. It is unknown, however, how to calculate the metabolic rate of an entire continent or on a global scale. According to the authors, riverine metabolic rates increase faster than accumulated watershed areas (superlinear scaling). By using allometric scaling, the researchers show how river network shape, discharge, and local metabolic rates influence the relationship between biogeochemical function and watershed area. According to these findings, large basins contribute disproportionately to global carbon metabolism. 

Now, let's dive in, but before that:

The keyword we are looking for is **fractals**. Have you ever heard about them? If  the concept sounds too foreing, let's *break it down* into pieces:

* 1. According to the [Online Etymology Dictionary](https://www.etymonline.com/word/fractal)a fractal is ""never-ending pattern," 1975, from French fractal, ultimately from Latin fractus "interrupted, irregular," literally "broken," past participle of frangere "to break" (from PIE root [*bhreg-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*bhreg-?ref=etymonline_crossreference "Etymology, meaning and definition of *bhreg-") "to break"). Coined by French mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot (1924-2010) in "Les Objets Fractals.""
* The foundational math behind fractals is *Logarithms*. Yup that's it. All you need to remember is that:
