## Checking in
Potential science topics for open workflows with funding from NASA. If NASA rejects it, the proposal could be transformed into a white paper to apply to internal opportunity: LDRD money from Physics and Computational Science Directorate. They have Directorate objetives indicating that data management and FAIR data workflows is a strategic objective. We could also get some money from EBSD to develop the project. Another avenue in the subsector management position is to find ways to faciliate the development of white papers we could take to DOE to influence DOE thinking in the short and long term. It is not uncommon for DOE to open up some financial resources. 
## On the Fly Agenda

## Notes
[[Francisco Guerrero]] will update the data provided by [[Kyongho Son]] and re-run the codes to update scaling figures. 
[[James Stegen]] is thinking about the role of water column respiration to evaluate the relationship between side level of water column. Ximming is doing the stats. I could ask her to run an analysis between watershed area.
[[James Stegen]] also thinks that the cotton strip data from all the same locations, also lab measurements of sediment respiration. 
We would be looking at the different components of the metabolic system across the basin. 
[[Francisco Guerrero]] also proposes to calculate local slopes and estimate the contribution of the local scaling to the superlinear slope across the entire watershed.
